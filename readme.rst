Application testing helper
========================

Nothing revolutionary in here. Though I haven't seen such project/library/framework (that would be actually good and usable).

For now this is very simple prototype to evolve. Idea is to have most/all (automated) testing needed in a project in one place.

Driver/s can be written for any part of the application/system/multiple applications and then used in tests. Most of the time via additional layer/s that will simplify the usage.

You can see high level structure with example drivers at https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lezi47Y=/

Tracking tasks, bugs, features at (private for now) https://app.clickup.com/2507589/v/b/s/6727213

- Move TODOs there (haha)
