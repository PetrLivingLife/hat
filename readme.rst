Universal testing helper
========================

Nothing revolutionary in here. Though I haven't seen such project/library/framework (that would be actually good and usable).

For now this is very simple prototype to evolve. Idea is to have most/all (automated) testing needed in a project in one place.

For any part of the application/system/multiple applications driver(s) can be written and then used in tests.

You can see high level structure with example drivers at https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lezi47Y=/
